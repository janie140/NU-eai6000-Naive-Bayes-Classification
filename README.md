Overview
In class we derived the formualtion of Markov Chains for the purpose of predicting future states of a system. In particular we discussed 1st order markov chains, where the future state only depended on a single last known state. In this exercise we'll see how to extend the same ideas to longer sequences of the last known state. We will apply this methodology to forecast probable wins and losses of the LA Lakers for the current season, with 29 more games still to be played in this current season!
